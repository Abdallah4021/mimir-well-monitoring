The master branch was left intintionally blank, as the project has lots of sub-projects, each branch excluding the master branch are of them self sub-project.

For example, the gateway code is in a separate branch as it's a sub-project, the same goes for the code of the sink.

## Instructions on pushing

To push the repository, create a branch on you local repository with the name of the sub-project, commit the code and then push as follows:

```git
git push origin localBranch:remoteBranchs
```
